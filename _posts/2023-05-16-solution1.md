This is a solution to the first level. It should only be published part-way
through the night, unless I push it early by mistake!

## Solution

[Here's the full source online](https://github.com/BSidesSF/ctf-2023/tree/main/challenges/getout1-warmup/solution)

To solve level 1, you need to connect to a service. How that's done is covered
in the [protocol docs](/protocol).

Basically, using `libgetout.rb` (on the [implementation page](/protocol-implementation-ruby)):

```ruby
require './libgetout'

begin
  s = connect(ARGV[0], ARGV[1] || 1337)
  flag, narrative = use(s, 'ping')

  puts "Fetched narrative: #{ narrative }"
  puts "Fetched flag: #{ flag }"
  exit 0
ensure
  s.close if s
end
```
