These are hints for the first challenge. Use at your own discretion!

## Vulnerability types

There isn't a specific vulnerability here - you're handed the flag as soon as
you connect to the service correctly.

What you need to do for this challenge is to implement the protocol! I've
detailed the protocol [here](/protocol). It's somewhat complex, but that's
the fun!
