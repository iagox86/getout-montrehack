## Challenge

Greetings, human.

As the final task before moving you to Space Paradise, we need you to upgrade
your flavor profi-- err, your technical specifications.

Using the "Get Out Solutions" tool, please connect to the `apply` RPC service
and follow the instructions! Have your token ready.

> *bzzzzt* okay, we analyzed the token you found and we think we see what's
> going on. We're attaching the `apply` executable, your job now is to gain
> access to the system and run `/bin/shutdown`. You'll receive your final
> message (on stdout).
>
> Can YOU save all of humanity??
