This will describe the RPC protocol. It's a big hint, so only read this if you
want to skip ahead!

This protocol is implemented in [libgetout.so](/blogdata/libgetout.so), but
that's obviously compiled and requires substantial reverse engineering.

This is going to start broad and get more spoilery as you read down. Consume
as much or as little as you'd like!

## High-level

At a high level, this is an RPC protocol. Each message consists of a 16-byte
header followed by a body. The header contains metadata about the packet,
including a length and CRC32. Then the body is divided into two parts:
metadata (types/length) and data (values).

## Specifics

The header is 16 bytes, and compromised of four 32-bit big endian values:

* `version` - never changes
* `CRC32` - of the body
* `length` - of the body
* `argcount` - number of packed arguments

The metadata section is comprised of `argcount` 8-byte values. Each of those
values is two 32-bit big endian integers:

* `type`:
  * Type 1 = `int64`
  * Type 2 = `string`
  * Type 3 = `binary`
  * Type 4 = `float`
* `length` (only applicable for type `binary`)
  * The number of bytes in the data section

The data section is comprised of `argcount` values, each of whose format
depends on the `type` from the metadata section. The types are encoded as:

* `int64` - a single 64-bit big endian value
* `string` - any number of bytes, terminated by a NUL byte (`\0`)
* `binary` - any number of bytes, including NUL bytes, up to the defined length
* `float` - a 64-bit float, but I never actually implemented this one

## Example

This is the request that will list services by name:

```
Request:

00000000  00 00 00 02 61 ab 52 db  00 00 00 10 00 00 00 01   ....a.R. ........

Response:

```

With annotations on the fields:

### Part 1: Warm up

For the first challenge, you just need to connect to a service. The message
for connecting to a service has two arguments:

1. An `int64` opcode with the value 1
2. A `string` with the name of the service

Eg:

```
00000020  00 00 00 02 36 77 97 ec  00 00 00 24 00 00 00 02   ....6w.. ...$....
00000030  00 00 00 01 00 00 12 34  00 00 00 02 00 00 43 21   .......4 ......C!
00000040  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01  73 65 72 76 69 63 65 6e   ........ servicen
00000050  61 6d 65 00                                        ame.
```

### Part 2: Get token

For the second challenge, connect to the `gettoken` endpoint the same way you
connect in Part 1.

Then send a request to get token. The request looks like:

* (string) Username
* (string) Password

If the username and password are correct, it will succeed and send you the
token needed for Part 3 (and also a flag).

The problem is, there are no correct usernames in the system - you need to find
a bypass!

### Part 3: Apply

For the final challenge, you need to connect to the `apply` endpoint.

Requests to the `apply` endpoint begin with an `int64` opcode, followed by
different messages depending on the opcode.

Four opcodes are defined:

* `OPCODE_INSTRUCTIONS` = 100
  * (no additional arguments)
* `OPCODE_IDENTIFY` = 101
  * (string) token from part 2
* `OPCODE_APPLY` = 102
  * 5x (string) values - run `OPCODE_INSTRUCTIONS` to find out what they represent
* `OPCODE_CHECK_STATUS` = 103
  * (binary) The encrypted token returned by `OPCODE_APPLY`
