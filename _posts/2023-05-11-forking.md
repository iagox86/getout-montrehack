The `getoutrpc` executable forks, and that's a pain to deal with. But you're in
luck! I've done some writing on how to deal with that.

This is supposed to be part of the challenge, but if you want to jump past this
and get to debugging / hacking, keep reading!

In preparation for this event, I wrote a
[blog post on dealing with forking](https://www.skullsecurity.org/2023/fork-off-three-ways-to-deal-with-forking-processes)!
I suggest skipping to "Technique 3", that'll work best for you.

If you want to skip all that and just get a copy of `getoutrpc` that doesn't
fork, here you go:
